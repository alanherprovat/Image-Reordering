## Image-Reordering

I've created a responsive image gallery using React JS with the following features: reordering, deleting multiple images, and setting a feature image. The gallery is quite visually appealing and provide a seamless user experience.

## Functionalities:
1. **Gallery Layout:**
   - Implemented a grid layout for the image gallery.
   - The gallery display images with one feature image larger than the others.
2. **Sorting:**
   - Enabled reordering functionality to allow users to rearrange the order of images in the gallery.
   - Implemented drag-and-drop functionality using React-DnD.
3. **Deleting Multiple Images:**
   - Allows users to select multiple images and delete them.
   - Provides a clear visual indication of selected images.
4. **Setting Feature Image:**
   - Allows users to set a feature image by sorting.
   - Assumptions are made such that first image (from the LTR direction) as the featured image
   - The feature image is visually distinct from the other images with a blue border wrapping the grid.
5. **User Experience:**
   - A smooth and responsive user experience is ensured.
   - Implemented transitions/animations for a polished look and feel.
6. [**Live Demo:**]:https://reodering-image-gallery-react-dnd.netlify.app/
   - After completing Production build, project is being deployed at Netlify.
